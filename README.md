# MomsDuplicateDeleter
A program to identify and delete duplicate files from a single or set of paths (i.e. drives connected to the computer at the time)..

This program was written for my mom to be able to get rid of the many duplicates spread over many directories and external USB Drives. I have always wanted a program such as this for myself, but my requirements are too big.  My mom is willing to get rid of either of the duplicates, which makes the implementation much easier.  The first prototype is called FFS, for some reason that I no longer remember.

Known Issues:  
1. Filenames with some special characters (I know the apostrophe character is a problem) are not deleted properly.  It will properly delete with the select single file button, but no the others.
